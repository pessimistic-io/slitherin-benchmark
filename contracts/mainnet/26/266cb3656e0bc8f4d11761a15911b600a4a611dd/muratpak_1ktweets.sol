Minted as a commemoration of @poetslost on this wonderful day and will be gifted to @muratpak\|01f90d h\[Ellipsis]Revealed so far:

@poetslost is an NFT, collected as pages.

Collectors can now keep their Pages or turn them into Poets.

After the 2 week swap, Pages can be used to rename Poets and supply words for poetry.

The rarities of Poets reveal over time.

https://t.co/Ab1BUjXn7VEvery poet is mute when they're created.
They learn poetry with pages.I can't recognize my face.@richerd @hunterorrell @delfabz :]Already have 300 $ASH bid on ASHLooks good.@poetslost What should I call you dear?PQMZ https://t.co/Sm8zISI75URT @poetslost: Hello PQMZRT @muratpak: uwuRT @muratpak: Tick.
Tock.RT @Darlington: @JordanLyall Origin PoetsDo you like easter eggs?@ShortsHoward Thank you for the amazing talk, unfortunately my pod is far away from the planet, creates a lot of delay, making it hard to communicate :] I will join you again hopefully when I'm closer!@mom_shredder Yes, as, origins will be dropped to the poets that carry the same origin. So, more poets = more tickets for daily airdrops.Design. https://t.co/tschjhGC6TYes, they will be used. https://t.co/m5YsSZwMGTSorry about that. https://t.co/UzE63Q9dNE@nullinger @poetslost 6? Not really. No minimum/Maximum here.Maybe Banksy was the old world's Pak https://t.co/3oxRDLsmfCLet it go, I dare you. https://t.co/YTkOorHlRo@SlywestYo bingo!42 https://t.co/8Gj784tFRW@KunstmannETH When a page is used, it's used. No more turning back.@gaddipati_teja Rarities.@PrestonLangle14 @XRP_revolution * steals pages *@0Nft1 After the 2 week window."What does it mean to rename an Origin?"

Each poet has Latent and Origin attributes (Position category). When an Origin (Poet) is renamed, the that Origin attributes name is changed throughout the whole collection.

So it's a collection scale modification.@poetslost \|01f680It's random.

Primary reason of having a 2 week conversion window is to minimize gas fees, and let collectors comprehend the concepts to make a proper move rather than FOMO. https://t.co/prHLdJFKtU@AVCRYPTOPOT ♾ Pages, Limited word slots for Poetry (Token Description)@Ape_mom_bobo I'm sure there will be fake ones on OS.Once again, 65k is a tiny number.It won't. Because this is a dynamic balance.

If every Page converts to a Poet, the final collector will think many times to convert that 1/1 to a Poet. https://t.co/Arf7RvyAYn@Sbreezy_88 @poetslost &lt;3@dqniellew Yes. https://t.co/WeMWU2Ulmo"Do I feed pages to my Poets tomorrow?"

No. This is ACT II: The Reveal - 2 week long "Pages to Poets" conversion.

Act III: The Explorer will allow you to start using Pages on Poets.There is ACT IV: The Twist, remember? https://t.co/YIXxhs7Kok@Doodlxr @poetslost &lt;3Of course. https://t.co/wYtFLgukLy@jupiternifty @Sothebys \|01f507Conversion is 2 weeks, starting tomorrow. When doors are closed, Pages are Pages and Poets are Poets. https://t.co/2117hhgZ52@MafriendsArt Only Poets.Origin Poets are free to write anything. They do not need words, they do not need pages. They are unchained.

Every other poet is chained to the random set of words they are given. https://t.co/lP1avzHMev"Can I rename a mute poet?"

As soon as you feed it a page, it will have words, and a rename.

Yes, you can.

Maybe you will hunt for a rare poet, then give it some pages, who knows?"Can I rename my poet?"

Yes. Every page you feed to your poet gives you +1 "rename". "Rename" is a token attribute, you do not have to use it.

You can buy or sell a poet with 3 unused "renames" remaining."Is there a rarity structure with @poetslost tokens?"

Yes. Every poet (with or without words) has a number of attributes. These attributes will emerge over time.

It's up to you whether you retain your poet until full potential or flip."How do I write poetry with @poetslost ?"

Each Page can be converted to a poet. For each page you feed to your poet, you get +x additional random words.

Words can be reordered by you to create a poem.

Words have rarities.@bandoleo1 I would not ask others ;)@alexdoteth How good of a poet are you?
