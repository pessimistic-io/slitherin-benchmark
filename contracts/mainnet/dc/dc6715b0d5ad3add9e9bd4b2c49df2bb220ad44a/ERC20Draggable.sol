/**
 * @title ERC-20 tokens subject to a drag-along agreement
 * @author Luzius Meisser, luzius@aktionariat.com
 *
 * This is an ERC-20 token that is bound to a shareholder or other agreement that contains
 * a drag-along clause. The smart contract can help enforce this drag-along clause in case
 * an acquirer makes an offer using the provided functionality. If a large enough quorum of
 * token holders agree, the remaining token holders can be automatically "dragged along" or
 * squeezed out. For shares non-tokenized shares, the contract relies on an external Oracle
 * to provide the votes of those.
 *
 * Subclasses should provide a link to a human-readable form of the agreement.
