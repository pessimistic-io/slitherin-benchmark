/**
 * This is a rewrite from OZ Contratcs to use the StorageSlot Library funcionalities, even with arrays and mappings. Enjoy!

 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the begining of each new block. When overridding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

     * ====
     * While an open way of calling {_snapshot} is required for certain trust minimization mechanisms such as forking,

     * First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
     * logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target
     * specific accounts and increase the cost of ERC20 transfers for them, in the ways specified in the Gas Costs
     * section above.

            When a valid snapshot is queried, there are three possibilities:

             created for this id, and all stored snapshot ids are smaller than the requested one. The value that corresponds
             to this id is the current one.
             b) The queried value was modified after the snapshot was taken. Therefore, there will be an entry with the
             requested id, and its value is the one to return.
             c) More snapshots were created after the requested one, and the queried value was later modified. There will be
             no entry for the requested id: the value that corresponds to it is that of the smallest snapshot id that is
             larger than the requested one.
