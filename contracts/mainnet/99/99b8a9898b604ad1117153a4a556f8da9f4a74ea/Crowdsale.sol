 * @dev Borrow from https://github.dev/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/docs-v2.x/contracts/crowdsale/Crowdsale.ol and upgrade to solidity v0.8.0
 * @dev Crowdsale is a base contract for managing a token crowdsale,
 * allowing investors to purchase tokens with ether. This contract implements
 * such functionality in its most fundamental form and can be extended to provide additional
 * functionality and/or custom behavior.
 * The external interface represents the basic interface for purchasing tokens, and conforms
 * the base architecture for crowdsales. It is *not* intended to be modified / overridden.
 * The internal interface conforms the extensible and modifiable surface of crowdsales. Override
 * the methods to add functionality. Consider using 'super' where appropriate to concatenate
 * behavior.
