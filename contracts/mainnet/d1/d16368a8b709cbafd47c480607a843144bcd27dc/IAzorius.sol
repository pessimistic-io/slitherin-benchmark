/**
 * The base interface for the Azorius governance Safe module.
 * Azorius conforms to the Zodiac pattern for Safe modules: https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac
 *
 * Azorius manages the state of Proposals submitted to a DAO, along with the associated strategies
 * ([BaseStrategy](../BaseStrategy.md)) for voting that are enabled on the DAO.
 *
 * Any given DAO can support multiple voting BaseStrategies, and these strategies are intended to be
 * as customizable as possible.
 *
 * Proposals begin in the `ACTIVE` state and will ultimately end in either
 * the `EXECUTED`, `EXPIRED`, or `FAILED` state.
 *
 * `ACTIVE` - a new proposal begins in this state, and stays in this state
 *          for the duration of its voting period.
 *
 * `TIMELOCKED` - A proposal that passes enters the `TIMELOCKED` state, during which
 *          it cannot yet be executed.  This is to allow time for token holders
 *          to potentially exit their position, as well as parent DAOs time to
 *          initiate a freeze, if they choose to do so. A proposal stays timelocked
 *          for the duration of its `timelockPeriod`.
 *
 * `EXECUTABLE` - Following the `TIMELOCKED` state, a passed proposal becomes `EXECUTABLE`,
 *          and can then finally be executed on chain by anyone.
 *
 * `EXECUTED` - the final state for a passed proposal.  The proposal has been executed
 *          on the blockchain.
 *
 * `EXPIRED` - a passed proposal which is not executed before its `executionPeriod` has
 *          elapsed will be `EXPIRED`, and can no longer be executed.
 *
 * `FAILED` - a failed proposal (as defined by its [BaseStrategy](../BaseStrategy.md) 
 *          `isPassed` function). For a basic strategy, this would mean it received more 
 *          NO votes than YES or did not achieve quorum.
