/// @notice Extension of ERC4626 and implementation of `ITierV2` that records all
/// mints and burns of the ERC4626 share token. `ITierV2` reports can be
/// generated according to the internal ledger of share mints. The `ITierV2`
/// context is treated as a list of thresholds that the owner must have minted
/// corresponding shares for. As per `ITierV2` the times that the owner minted
/// each threshold's amount of shares will be returned as a standard `ITierV2`
/// encoded report.
///
/// As per ERC4626 shares are minted according to prorata deposits of the
/// underlying asset defined at initialization. For example, increasing the total
/// assets deposited by 10% entitles the depositor to increase the total supply
/// of share tokens by 10%, minted for themselves on their ledger. Burns are the
/// inverse logic, e.g. burning 10% of the share supply releases 10% of the
/// underlying asset.
///
/// The dual ERC4626/ITierV2 implementation allows for native hybrid incentives.
///
/// The underlying ERC4626 asset can be transferred directly to `Stake` without
/// minting any shares for the transfer. This effectively distributes those
/// assets prorata between all shares outstanding at that moment. Subsequent
/// share mints and burns will calculate against this larger underlying asset
/// pool. I.e. new entrants have to provide more assets to mint the same number
/// of shares and existing holders receive more assets per share when they burn
/// than when they deposited.
///
/// At the same time, the staking ledger is exposed dynamically to incoming
/// `report` calls according to runtime thresholds. This allows external
/// incentives/access to be defined and updated over time. A single staking
/// ledger could be reinterpreted for use in many external tier-based algorithms.
/// For example, users could lose access to some exclusive event/group unless
/// they periodically increase their share ledger to a minimum by some deadline.
/// The external group simply winds up the thresholds passed as context to
/// `report` over time and the existing ledger is reinterpreted accordingly.
///
/// Note that the total shares in circulation and the totals of the final entries
/// in every account's ledgers is always 1:1. `Stake` doesn't allow for
/// expressing inflationary tokenomics in the share token itself. Third party
/// tokens may mint/burn themselves according to the share balances and ledger
/// reports provided by `Stake`.
