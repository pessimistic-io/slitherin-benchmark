/// and liquidity. Each exchange has its own instance of TokenVault, which provides isolation of the funds between
/// different exchanges and adds an additional layer of protection in case one exchange gets compromised.
/// Users are not meant to interact with this contract directly. For each exchange, only the TokenRouter and the
/// corresponding implementation of IAmm (for example, SpotMarketAmm) are authorized to withdraw funds. If new versions
/// of these contracts become available, then they can be approved and the old ones disapproved.
///
/// @dev We decided to make TokenVault non-upgradable. The implementation is very simple and in case of an emergency
/// recovery of funds, the VotingExecutor (which should be the owner of TokenVault) can approve arbitrary addresses
/// to withdraw funds.
