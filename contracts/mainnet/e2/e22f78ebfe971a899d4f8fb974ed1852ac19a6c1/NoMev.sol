/*
    NoMEV has a simple and smart solution to block sandwich bots. 
    
    MEV bots operate on bundles, which are transactions ordered strictly. 
    In order to profit, MEVs bundle the buy-victim buy-and-sell transactions together
    to determine if it's worth executing or not.
    
    Simply blocking the possibility of selling in the same block where they bought
    will prevent them from abusing people.
