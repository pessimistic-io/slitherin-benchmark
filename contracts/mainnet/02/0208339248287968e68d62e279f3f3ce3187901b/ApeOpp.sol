// The Ape Opportunities Coin is the pure and uncluttered apeing coin,
// designed for enthusiastic apes.
//
// ApeOpp is for those greedy apes who don’t care about blockchain technology
// or the functional value of protocols.
// It’s only value is to provide you with the excitement and exhilaration
// you only achieve by apeing into the latest sh%7coin.
//
// We're tired of looking for the perfect opportunity to APE into, so we developed our own,
// here’s how it works:
// - ApeOpp is launched in week one.
// - No TAX
// - No Blacklist / Whitelist
// - No Limits
// - No backdoors or blocks in contract, simple and safe
// - No contract owner
// - No rugpulls
// - Total supply used for initial LP
// - Initial liquidity is locked until 6/9/23 1:00:00 AM UTC
// - You have one week to enjoy Apeing into and trading ApeOpp.
// - At the end of week one, the following happens:
//      - Initial liquidity pulled out by ApeOpp devs
//      - ApeOpp tokens from LP are burned
//      - Anyone holding ApeOpp after this qualifies as a Proper Ape
//      - Proper Apes will be eligible for something special ...
