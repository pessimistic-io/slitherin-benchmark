/// @title A Futureswap V4 exchange for a single pair of tokens.
///
/// @notice An API for an exchange that manages leveraged trades for one pair of tokens.  One token
/// is called "asset" and it's address is returned by `assetToken()`. The other token is called
/// "stable" and it's address is returned by `stableToken()`.  Exchange is mostly symmetrical with
/// regard to how "asset" and "stable" are treated.
///
/// The API is designed for 3 roles:
///
///  - Traders
///      Use `changePosition()`.
///      Alternatively a position can be opened by doing an ERC677 token transfer of the stable token
///      to the exchange. `data` should the encoded bytes of the `ChangePositionData` struct.
///
///  - Liquidity providers
///      Liquidity provider can provide asset and stable tokens. Providing
///      tokens is done though calling `addLiquidity`, which requires the caller to be a smart contract
///      End users will use `LiquidityRouter`.  `LiquidityRouter` will use `addLiquidity()` provided by this interface.
///      Removing liquidity can either be done by calling `removeLiquidity` on the exchange
///      or doing an ERC677 token transfer of the liquidity token to the exchange. `data` should
///      contain the bytes of the `RemoveLiquidityData` struct.
///
///  - Liquidation bot(s)
///      Use `liquidate()`.
///
/// Liquidity providers receive `liquidityToken()` for providing liquidity.  They represents the
/// share of the liquidity pool a provider owns. The token is automatically staked into
/// the liquidity provider incentives contract.
/// Liquidity providers receive FST from the staking contract.
///
/// Traders receive FST tokens for trading.  Exchange automatically updates the `incentives()`
/// contract with the current position for every trader.
