/// @title The implementation of Futureswap's V4.1 exchange.
/// The ExchangeLedger keeps track of the position of all traders (including the AMM) that interact with
/// the system. A position of a trader is just its asset and stable balance.
/// A trade is an exchange of asset and stable between two traders, and is reflected
/// by the elementary function `tradeInternal`. Stable corresponds to an actual ERC20 that is
/// used for collateral in the system (usually a stable token, hence its name, but note that this is not
/// actually a restriction, and in fact we could have any ERC20 as stable). On the other hand, asset can
/// be synthetic, depending on the AMM (in our SpotMarketAmm, asset is directly tied to ERC20).
/// The invariants are thus:
///
/// (1) sum_traders stable(trader) = sum stable ERC20 send in - ERC20 send out = stableToken.balance(vault)
/// (2) sum_traders asset(trader) = 0
///
/// The value of a position is `stable(trader) + priceAssetInStable * asset(trader)`.
/// Using invariant (2), it's easy to see that the total value of all positions equals the stable token
/// balance in the vault. Furthermore, if no position has negative value (bankrupt) this implies that we
/// can close out all positions and return every trader the proper value of its position. For this reason,
/// we have a `liquidate` function that anybody can call to eliminate positions near bankruptcy and keep
/// the system safe.
///
/// Under normal operation, the AMM acts as another trader that is the counter-party to all trades
/// happening in the system. However, the AMM can reject a trade (ie. revert), for example,
/// in our SpotMarketAmm if there is not enough liquidity in the AMM to hedge the trade on a spot market.
/// If this is the case, then normally the exchange would reject the trade. However, there are situations
/// where it won't reject the trade. Liquidations and closes should not be rejected.
/// Liquidations should not be rejected because failing to eliminate bankrupt positions poses risk to the
/// integrity of the system. Closes should not be rejected because we want traders to always be able to exit
/// the system. In these cases, the system resorts to executing the trade against other traders as counter-party,
/// this is called `ADL` (Auto DeLeveraging).
///
/// ADL:
/// ADL is the most complicated part of the system. The blockchain constrains do not allow iterating over
/// all traders, so we need to be able to trade against traders in aggregate. ADL is essentially forcing
/// a trade on traders against their explicit wish to do so. Therefore we have another constraint from a
/// product design perspective that ADL'ing should happen against the riskiest traders first.
///
/// We met these constraints by aggregating traders based on their leverage (risk) and long/short into
/// tranches. For instance, if we ADL a long, we iterate over the short tranches from riskiest to
/// safest and iterate until we're done. If the long is still not fully closed, we ADL the remaining
/// against the AMM position (the AMM as a trader doesn't participate in any tranche).
///
/// Because we bundle trades into tranches, the actual data structure for a trader is `EntranchedPosition`
/// which consist of (trancheShares, stable, trancheIdx). And we have the following triangular matrix
/// transformation, to translate between them.
///
/// asset(trader)  = | asset(tranche)/totalTrancheShares   0 | x | trancheShares(trader) |
/// stable(trader)   | stable(tranche)/totalTrancheShares  1 |   | stable(trader)        |
///
/// We structured the code to first extract the trader position from the tranche, execute the trade,
/// and then insert the trade back in a tranche (could be a different one than the original).
/// ADL'ing simply executes a trade against the position of the tranche. One extra complication is that
/// over time, the above matrix can become ill-conditioned (ie. become singular and non-invertible).
/// This happens when `asset(tranche)/totalTrancheShares` becomes small. When we detect this case,
/// we ditch the tranche and start a new one. See `TRANCHE_INFLATION_MAX`.
///
/// Funding:
/// The system charges time fees and dynamic funding rate (DFR).
/// These fees are continuously charged over time and paid in stable. Both fees are designed such that
/// they are only dependent on the asset value of the position.
/// Because we cannot loop over all positions to update the positions with the correct funding at each time
/// we use a funding pot that each position has a share in (actually two pots one for long and one for short positions,
/// in the code called `longAccumulatedFunding` and `shortAccumulatedFunding`).
/// This way updating funding is a O(1) step of just updating the pot. Each positions share in the pot is
/// determined by the size of the position giving precisely the correct proportional funding rate.
/// The consequence is that a positions actual amount of stable satisfies
///        `stable = stable_without_funding + share_of_funding_pot`
/// We store stable_without_funding as it doesn't change on funding updates. This means that in order to correctly state
/// a position we need to add the share_of_funding_pot, this matters at all places where we calculate the value of
/// the position (for leverage/liquidation) or to calculate the execution price.
/// This accounting is similar to how we do tranches, by extracting the position out of the funding pool
/// before the trade and inserting it back in after the trade.
