/**
 * @notice Contract to accept requests for upkeep registrations
 * @dev There are 2 registration workflows in this contract
 * Flow 1. auto approve OFF / manual registration - UI calls `register` function on this contract, this contract owner at a later time then manually
 *  calls `approve` to register upkeep and emit events to inform UI and others interested.
 * Flow 2. auto approve ON / real time registration - UI calls `register` function as before, which calls the `registerUpkeep` function directly on
 *  keeper registry and then emits approved event to finish the flow automatically without manual intervention.
 * The idea is to have same interface(functions,events) for UI or anyone using this contract irrespective of auto approve being enabled or not.
 * they can just listen to `RegistrationRequested` & `RegistrationApproved` events and know the status on registrations.
