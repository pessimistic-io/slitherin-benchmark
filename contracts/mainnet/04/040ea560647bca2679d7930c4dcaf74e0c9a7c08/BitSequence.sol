/* @title BitSequence
 * @author minimizer <me@minimizer.art>; https://minimizer.art/
 * 
 * Based on OpenZeppelin's BitMap, this library allows the user to store a series of booleans
 * sequentially indexed at zero, and find the first index at which the boolean is set to true
 * starting at a given index and working backwards.
 * 
 * The use case is to assist in storing and efficiently retrieving the index of data stored
 * in a corresponding sparsely populated dataset. For example if five tokens have the same
 * attributea value it can be stored in just the id of the first token, and all other ones can
 * look back at that token's value, using the BitSequence to find the correct index.
