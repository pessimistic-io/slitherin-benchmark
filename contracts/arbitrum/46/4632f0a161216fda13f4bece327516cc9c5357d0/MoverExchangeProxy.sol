 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");

 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

/*
   Exchange Proxy is a middleware contract that acts as an abstraction layer for tokens exchange
   (ERC20 tokens and ETH)

   The current implementation is using 0x API for performing actual swap, as 0x is aiming for
   best execution, there's no complex logic for now regarding that.
   The contract is not intended to gather fees, be called by users, it is called by the transfer proxy,
   which is aimed to do that. This contract is attached to a transfer proxy, and has permission to
   create allowance for arbitrary token it would need access to.
   Both of exchange proxy and transfer proxy contracts do not hold funds, all operations are performed within
   single transaction.

   Exchange occurs in the following steps:
   1. This contract is provided with amount of tokens on its address directly by transfer proxy
      (thus does not requiring any allowance calls) for executeSwapDirect or it should have allowance
      if swapping through executeSwap;
   2. This contract is provided with data of how order is going to be routed (bytes swalCallData)
   3. 0x order routing may require that this contract should set allowance to some address to spend
      its tokens;
   4. The address that performs the swap is called with swapdata set;
   5. If swap is successful, this contract transfers tokens directly to beneficiary or
      back to the transfer proxy contract;
   6. Appropriate event is emitted with swap details;
   7. Fees (if applicable) are staying on this contract address.

   version additions:
   - support for Eth swap;
   - fixes for approve not returning bool on some contracts like USDT;
   - contract made not-upgradeable, proxy removed as contract does not have any state
     and some exchange functions cannot pass raw Eth to it due to gas stipend being not enough
     for upgradeable contracts making delegateCall to implementation. As the exchange proxy address
     can be set in transfer proxy, this results in no loss of flexibility, and also would reduce
     gas costs a bit for the users.
