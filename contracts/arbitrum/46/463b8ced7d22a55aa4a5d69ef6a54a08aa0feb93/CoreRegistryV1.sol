/**
 * @title Art Blocks Core Contract Registry, V1.
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice Privileged Roles and Ownership:
 * This contract has a single owner, and is intended to be deployed with a
 * permissioned owner that has elevated privileges on this contract.
 * If in the future multiple deployer addresses are needed to interact with
 * this registry, a new registry version with more complex logic should be
 * implemented and deployed to replace this.
 *
 * This contract builds on the EngineRegistryV0 contract, but encompases more
 * than just Engine contracts. It is updated to be named CoreRegistry, and is
 * V1 because it is the next iteration of the V0 Engine Registry.
 *
 * This contract is intended to be able to act as a registry of all core
 * contracts that are allowed to interact with a specific MinterFilter V2.
 * This includes, but is not limited to:
 * - Flagship contracts
 * - Collaboration contracts
 * - Engine contracts
 * - Engine Flex contracts
 *
 * Note that not all contracts will be registered in this registry, as some
 * contracts may not need to interact with a MinterFilterV2 contract. For
 * example, the original Art Blocks V0 contract does not need to interact with
 * a MinterFilterV2 contract, as it uses a different minting mechanism.
 *
 * A view function is provided to determine if a contract is registered.
 *
 * This contract is designed to be managed by an owner with privileged roles
 * and abilities.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following function is restricted to the engine registry owner sending,
 * or the core contract being registered during a transaction originating from
 * the engine registry owner:
 * - registerContract
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to the engine registry owner sending:
 * - unregisterContract
 * - registerContracts
 * - unregisterContracts
 * - Ownable: transferOwnership
 * - Ownable: renounceOwnership
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional privileged roles may be described on minters, registries, and
 * other contracts that may interact with this contract.
