/* A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there were those who understood that all life is connected,
between people, planets, and stars, a shared energy field binding all things together.
Now, as it was even in the old times, there are the rare few who can sense this field,
and even rarer among them those who can harness it.
Some who mastered The Force did so with their emotions and ego,
tapping the  dark side for their own benefit. Others took a more selfless route,
choosing to use The Force to serve others and help those in need.
The conflict between these two was inevitable, and today,
just as they have for thousands of years, the Jedi and Sith orders are at war.
Their weapons of choice: sabers of light bearing the colors of their order,
each crafted like a piece of art, each one of the most potent weapons in the galaxy.

As the war continues, both orders are in desperate need of heroes with the skill and focus to fight.
YOU could be one of those heroes.
Come claim your SABER and join the struggle to see which side of the Force will triumph.

Will you secure the saber of the SITH and fight for a future forged in the blood and screams of your weak Jedi enemies?
Will you don the JEDI saber and take a stand against the madness and tyranny of the unhinged Sith?
Or will you seek the middle path, wielding sabers of BOTH orders to maintain the balance of the Force? 

Make your choice! Show your saber proudly on your php! Recruit others who are fit to join you in the battle,
and make this war between Light Side and Dark Side the final one!

In the traditional battle of the force, the saga continues as mother is pitted against son.
Which generation shall prevail this century?

As always, May the Force be with you... Choose wisely, we hope you will.
