/**
The term "theta" refers to the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the time decay of an option.
This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturity, as long as everything is held constant. 
Theta is generally expressed as a negative number for long positions and as a positive number for short positions. 
It can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day.
