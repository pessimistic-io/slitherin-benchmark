/**
 * @notice Ownership contract for secondary chain which uses the Tellor oracle protocol to sync
 * the main chain owner returned by `getCurrentOwner()` function in `DIVAOwnershipMain.sol`.
 * @dev `setOwner()` function pulls the latest value that remained undisputed for more than 12 hours.
 * - Reverts with `NoOracleSubmission` if there is no value inside the Tellor smart contract that remained
 *   undisputed for more than 12 hours.
 * - Reverts with `ValueTooOld` if the last reported undisputed value is older than 36 hours.
 * 
 * Tellor reporters can verify the validity of a reported value by simulating the return value
 * of `getCurrentOwner()` on the main chain as of a block with a timestamp shortly before the
 * time of reporting using an archive node.
 *  
 * As Tellor is a permissionless system that allows anyone to report outcomes, constant
 * monitoring of value submissions is required. Incentives built into the Tellor system encourage
 * Tellor watchers to dispute inaccurate reportings. The main chain owner has a
 * natural incentive to participate as a Tellor watcher and dispute any wrong submissions.
 * In the event that an invalid submission goes unnoticed and a bad actor takes over ownership
 * on a secondary chain, the potential harm is limited. Functions such as `updateFees`,
 * `updateSettlementPeriods`, `updateFallbackDataProvider`, and `updateTreasury` have an
 * activation delay and can be revoked as soon as the rightful owner regains control. The
 * revoke functions as well as `pauseReturnCollateral` do not implement a delay and changes will
 * take immediate effect if triggered by an unauthorized account. Former will require the rightful
 * owner to trigger the updates again after regaining control. Latter will delay the possibility
 * to redeem by a maximum of 8 days, but will not interrupt the settlement process, ensuring that
 * all outstanding pools will settle correctly. The pause can be immediately reversed once the
 * rightful owner regains control.
