/**
 * @title A public multitoken ledger for defi
 * @author Cowri Labs Team
 * @dev The ocean is designed to interact with contracts that implement IERC20,
 *  IERC721, IERC-1155, or IOceanPrimitive.
 * @dev The ocean is three things.
 *  1. At the highest level, it is a defi framework[0]. Users provide a list
 *   of interactions, and the ocean executes those interactions. Each
 *   interaction involves a call to an external contract. These calls result
 *   in updates to the ocean's accounting system.
 *  2. Suporting this defi framework is an accounting system that can transfer,
 *   mint, or burn tokens. Each token in the accounting system is identified by
 *   its oceanId. Every oceanId is uniquely derived from an external contract
 *   address. This external contract is the only contract able to cause mints
 *   or burns of this token[1].
 *  3. Supporting this accounting system is an ERC-1155 ledger with all the
 *   standard ERC-1155 features. Users and primitives can interact with their
 *   tokens using both the defi framework and the ERC-1155 functions.

 * [0] We call it a framework because the ocean calls predefined functions on
 *  external contracts at certain points in its exection. The lifecycle is
 *  managed by the ocean, while the business logic is managed by external
 *  contracts.  Conceptually this is quite similar to a typical web framework.
 * [1] For example, when a user wraps an ERC-20 token into the ocean, the
 *   framework calls the ERC-20 transfer function, and upon success, mints the
 *   wrapped token to the user. In another case, when a user deposits a base
 *   token into a liquidity pool to recieve liquidity provider tokens, the
 *   framework calls the liquidity pool, tells it how much of the base token it
 *   will receive, and asks it how much of the liquidity provider token it
 *   would like to mint. When the pool responds, the framework mints this
 *   amount to the user.
 *
 * @dev Getting started tips:
 *  1. Check out Interactions.sol
 *  2. Read through the implementation of Ocean.doInteraction(), glossing over
 *   the function call to _executeInteraction().
 *  3. Read through the imlementation of Ocean.doMultipleInteractions(), again
 *   glossing over the function call to _executeInteraction(). When you
 *   encounter calls to LibBalanceDelta, check out their implementations.
 *  4. Read through _executeInteraction() and all the functions it calls.
 *   Understand how this is the line separating the accounting for the external
 *   contracts and the accounting for the current user.
 *   You can read the implementations of the specific interactions in any
 *   order, but it might be good to go through them in order of increasing
 *   complexity. The called functions, in order of increasing complexity, are:
 *   wrapErc721, unwrapErc721, wrapErc1155, unwrapErc1155, computeOutputAmount,
 *   computeInputAmount, unwrapErc20, and wrapErc20.  When you get to 
 *   computeOutputAmount, check out IOceanPrimitive, IOceanToken, and the
 *   function registerNewTokens() in OceanERC1155.
