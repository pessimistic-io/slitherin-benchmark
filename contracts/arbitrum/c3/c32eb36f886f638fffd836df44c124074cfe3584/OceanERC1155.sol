     * @dev Registered Tokens are tokens issued directly on the ocean's 1155 ledger.
     * @dev These are tokens that cannot be wrapped or unwrapped.
     * @dev We don't validate the inputs.  The happy path usage is for callers
     *  to obtain authority over tokens that have their ids derived from
     *  successive nonces.
     *
     *  registerNewTokens(0, n):
     *      _calculateOceanId(caller, 0)

     *    token => authority
     *  but not the one to many relationship of:
     *    authority => tokens
     *  it is nice UX to be able to re-derive the tokens on the fly from the
     *  authority's address and successive (predictable) nonces are used.
     *
     *  However, if the caller wants to use this interface in a different way,
     *  they could easily make a call like:
     *  registerNewTokens($SOME_NUMBER, 1); to use $SOME_NUMBER
     *  as the nonce.  A user could request to buy an in-ocean nft with a
     *  specific seed value, and the external contract gains authority over
     *  this id on the fly in order to sell it.
     *
     *  If the caller tries to reassert authority over a token they've already
     *  registered, they just waste gas.  If a caller expects to create
     *  new tokens over time, it should track how many tokens it has already
     *  created
     * @dev the guiding philosophy is to track only essential information in
     *  the Ocean's state, and let users (both EOAs and contracts) track other
     *  information as they see fit.
