 * @title BridgeConnector
 * @dev Bridge Connector implementation that interfaces with Hop Exchange only for now.
 *
 * It inherits from BaseImplementation which means it's implementation can be used directly from the Mimic Registry,
 * it does not require initialization.
 *
 * IMPORTANT! As many other implementations in this repo, this contract is intended to be used as a LIBRARY, not
 * a contract. Due to limitations of the Solidity compiler, it's not possible to work with immutable variables in
 * libraries yet. Therefore, we are relying on contracts without storage variables so they can be safely
 * delegate-called if desired.
