/**
 * @title Shared, filtered Minter contract that allows tokens to be minted with
 * ETH when purchaser owns an allowlisted ERC-721 NFT. This contract does NOT
 * track if a purchaser has/has not minted already -- it simply restricts
 * purchasing to anybody that holds one or more of a specified list of ERC-721
 * NFTs. Pricing is achieved using an automated, linear Dutch-auction mechanism.
 * This is designed to be used with GenArt721CoreContractV3 flagship or
 * engine contracts.
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice Privileged Roles and Ownership:
 * This contract is designed to be managed, with limited powers.
 * Privileged roles and abilities are controlled by the project's artist, which
 * can be modified by the core contract's Admin ACL contract. Both of these
 * roles hold extensive power and can modify minter details.
 * Care must be taken to ensure that the admin ACL contract and artist
 * addresses are secure behind a multi-sig or other access control mechanism.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to the minter filter's Admin ACL
 * contract:
 * - setMinimumPriceDecayHalfLifeSeconds
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to the core contract's Admin ACL
 * contract:
 * - resetAuctionDetails (note: this will prevent minting until a new auction
 *   is created)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist:
 * - setAuctionDetails (note: this may only be called when there is no active
 *   auction)
 * - syncProjectMaxInvocationsToCore
 * - manuallyLimitProjectMaxInvocations
 * - allowHoldersOfProjects
 * - removeHoldersOfProjects
 * - allowAndRemoveHoldersOfProjects
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional admin and artist privileged roles may be described on other
 * contracts that this minter integrates with.
 *
 * This contract allows gated minting with support for vaults to delegate minting
 * privileges via an external delegation registry. This means a vault holding an
 * allowed token can delegate minting privileges to a wallet that is not holding an
 * allowed token, enabling the vault to remain air-gapped while still allowing minting.
 * The delegation registry contract is responsible for managing these delegations,
 * and is available at the address returned by the public immutable
 * `delegationRegistryAddress`. At the time of writing, the delegation
 * registry enables easy delegation configuring at https://delegate.cash/.
 * Art Blocks does not guarentee the security of the delegation registry, and
 * users should take care to ensure that the delegation registry is secure.
 * Delegations must be configured by the vault owner prior to purchase. Supported
 * delegation types include token-level, contract-level (via genArt721CoreAddress), or
 * wallet-level delegation. Contract-level delegations must be configured for the core
 * token contract as returned by the public immutable variable `genArt721CoreAddress`.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @notice Caution: While Engine projects must be registered on the Art Blocks
 * Core Registry to assign this minter, this minter does not enforce that a
 * project is registered when configured or queried. This is primarily for gas
 * optimization purposes. It is, therefore, possible that fake projects may be
 * configured on this minter, but they will not be able to mint tokens due to
 * checks performed by this minter's Minter Filter.
 *
 *  @dev Note that while this minter makes use of `block.timestamp` and it is
 * technically possible that this value is manipulated by block producers, such
 * manipulation will not have material impact on the price values of this minter
 * given the business practices for how pricing is congfigured for this minter
 * and that variations on the order of less than a minute should not
 * meaningfully impact price given the minimum allowable price decay rate that
 * this minter intends to support.
