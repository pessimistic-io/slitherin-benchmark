 * @title:  EIP-20: Token Standard 
 * @author: Fabian Vogelsteller, Vitalik Buterin
 * @notice The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within
 *      smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well
 *      as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.
 * @custom:source https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20
 * @custom:change-log external -> external, string -> string memory (0.8.x)
 * @custom:change-log readability enhanced
 * @custom:change-log backwards compatability to EIP 165 added
 * @custom:change-log MIT -> Apache-2.0
