/**
 * @title MinterFilterV2
 * @dev At the time of deployment, this contract is intended to be used with
 * core contracts that implement IGenArt721CoreContractV3_Base.
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice This Minter Filter V2 contract allows minters to be set on a
 * per-project basis, for any registered core contract. This minter filter does
 * not extend the previous version of the minter filters, as the previous
 * version is not compatible with multiple core contracts.
 *
 * This contract is designed to be managed by an Admin ACL contract, as well as
 * delegated privileges to core contract artists and Admin ACL contracts.
 * These roles hold extensive power and can arbitrarily control and modify
 * how a project's tokens may be minted.
 * Care must be taken to ensure that the admin ACL contract and artist
 * addresses are secure behind a multi-sig or other access control mechanism.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted as allowed by this contract's Admin
 * ACL:
 * - updateCoreRegistry
 * - approveMinterGlobally
 * - revokeMinterGlobally
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted as allowed by each core contract's
 * Admin ACL contract:
 * - approveMinterForContract
 * - revokeMinterForContract
 * - removeMintersForProjectsOnContract
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted as allowed by each core contract's
 * Admin ACL contract, or to the artist address of the project:
 * - setMinterForProject
 * - removeMinterForProject
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional admin and artist privileged roles may be described on minters,
 * registries, and other contracts that may interact with this contract.
