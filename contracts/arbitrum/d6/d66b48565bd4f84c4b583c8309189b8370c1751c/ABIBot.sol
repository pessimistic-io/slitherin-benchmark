The code involves capital security of the most core variables swapper in the release (or after initConf method initialization) can not be modified.

Administrator Privileges.

    Administrator privileges (for the AI Core program to call, although the administrator's privileges are extremely limited and absolutely unlikely to result in a loss of principal, the funder may withdraw administrator privileges at any time due to the 100% certainty of ownership of the robot and associated assets from the code).
    1. swapFunction method initiates the transaction, and the destination address of the exchange is the default value (i.e. the address of the contract itself) and cannot be modified.

Commitment.

    As of November 8, 2023, after the update, ABIBot.com (registered in Marshall Islands as Sigma Holdings Limited, hereinafter referred to as "we") promises the following to all users who pay for the use of ABIBot's proprietary trading scripts.
    1. The code we have published is the complete code for your chain-run money security management contract, please complete the compilation yourself in our designated compilation environment, if the results of the compilation of your chain-run money management contract is consistent with the results of your use of this code to compile the results of their own use of the use, or please stop using it, immediately contact us. Any legal commitments we make below are subject to the condition that the bytecode of the contracts you run on the link matches the compilation of this source code.
    2. To the best of our current knowledge, we believe that what you are looking at is safe for your digital currency principal. We guarantee that we have not intentionally inserted any malicious backdoor code known to computer science (at the time of code release).
    3. Before the Code was deployed on the EtherNet, Blockchain Institiute, a blockchain research organization based in the United States of America, was commissioned to conduct a professional assessment of the security of the digital assets that users are authorized to invoke in the Contract. The audit report published by the organization after due diligence showed that it is unlikely that any of the digital assets that users are authorized to invoke in the Contract will be lost as a result of the Contract or any process related to it, except in exceptional circumstances. We undertake that if the digital assets authorized by the User to be accessed under this Contract or any program related to this Contract result in any loss of assets, whether intentional or unintentional, other than the loss of fuel costs due to the occurrence of a failed transaction in exceptional circumstances, we shall not be liable for any loss of assets.
    4. We undertake to reimburse you for any monetary loss of digital assets caused by an error in logic or a bug in the code that was not detected at the time of its development, but only up to the amount of your loss minus the total amount of your historical profits from the use of this Agreement.

Refusal of Commitment: 1.

    1. We refuse to make any commitment to the future price of any digital asset in fiat currency at any time in the future in any real world trading scene (DEX, CEX, OTC, etc.), even if we have made a clear and optimistic forecast of the future value of a particular digital asset or assets or have done so in writing, it does not mean that we are committing to the future price of the digital asset or assets.
    2. We refuse to be responsible for the safety of the funds of our experiential users who use our ABIBot without using any of our published money management contracts.

Special Note: This contract is a security-enhanced version of ABI.Bot released on November 8, 2023, and we guarantee the security of previous versions until this contract is deployed on the EtherNet.

Compile environment: +commit.4fc 
    
    https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=true&runs=200&evmVersion=berlin&version=soljson-v0.8.22+commit.4fc1097e.js

Consistency check.

    Please set up your compilation environment according to the specified compilation parameters and finish compiling. Compare the Bytecode (compilation result) with the Bytecode of your private contract address in the block browser to ensure consistency, or at least to prove that the source code you are currently seeing is identical to the source code of your private contract address. Ensuring code consistency is a prerequisite for evaluating the security of your code.

Token Authorization.

    Authorization of the transaction of the token contract: according to the need to authorize a variety of tokens, the current ABI.Bot mainly for: weth9, weth.x, wbtc.x, Aave WETH (aWETH), interBTC, wBTC and other encapsulated coins to optimize.

    The number of tokens authorized for trading: in order to avoid the frequent occurrence of insufficient authorization, it is recommended that the number of tokens authorized is not less than 10,000, and authorization means that you understand or fully trust the contract to ensure the safety of your funds.

The most important note: the contract's external method xCall.

    The external method xCall of this contract is the real method for robots to call the user's funds, the method in the code constraints in the same block must meet the contributor does not lose money, otherwise the contract reports an error, the transaction fails. This is a fundamental absolute guarantee of the security of the transaction.
