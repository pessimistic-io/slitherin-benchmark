  /**
   * @dev returns the amount for a recurring dutch auction based on the blockInterval segment state.
   *
   * This can be used with input or output amount to create a "dutch auction" where the auction starts on a price that is
   * more favorable to the intent signer, and ends on a price that is more favorable to the solver.
   
   * In the case of "output", this would be a decreasing required amount. In the case of "input", this would be an increasing
   * allowed amount.
   *
   * "auction" in variable names refers to the linear graph when amount is changing from startPercentE6 to endPercentE6. The settlement
   * of a swap could occur before or after this range.
   *
   * Expects these encoded bytes params:
   * - blockIntervalId: The id provided to the blockInterval segment
   * - firstAuctionStartBlock: The block when the first dutch auction will start
   * - auctionDelayBlocks: The number of blocks to wait for the next auction to start after the previous auction has closed. Should be
   *                       set to the same value as intervalMinSize of blockInterval
   * - auctionDurationBlocks: The number of blocks for amount to change from the start percent to the end percent relative to oracle
   * - startPercentE6: Percentage of the PriceOracle reported amount where the auction curve should start, multiplied by 10**6
   * - endPercentE6: Percentage of the PriceOracle reported amount where the auction curve should end, multiplied by 10**6
   * - priceX96Oracle: IUint256Oracle that should report the price
   * - priceX96OracleParams: params for the priceX96Oracle.getUint256() call
   *
   * When used with the blockInterval segment, getAmount() returns a dynamic value starting at a percentage above or below
   * a reported price value, and ending at a percentage above or below a reported price value.
