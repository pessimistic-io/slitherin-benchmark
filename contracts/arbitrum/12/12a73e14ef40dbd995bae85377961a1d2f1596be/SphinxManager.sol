/**
 * @title SphinxManager
 * @custom:version 0.2.4
 * @notice This contract contains the logic for managing the entire lifecycle of a project's
 *         deployments. It contains the functionality for approving and executing deployments and
 *         exporting proxies out of the Sphinx system if desired. It exists as a single
 *         implementation contract behind SphinxManagerProxy contracts, which are each owned by a
 *         single project team.
 *
 *         After a deployment is approved, it is executed in the following steps, which must occur
 *         in order:
 *         1. The `executeInitialActions` function: `DEPLOY_CONTRACT` and `CALL` actions are
 *            executed in ascending order according to their index.
 *         The next steps only occur if the deployment is upgrading proxies.
 *         2. The `initiateProxies` function: sets the implementation of each proxy to a contract
 *            that can only be called by the user's SphinxManager. This ensures that the upgrade is
 *            atomic, which means that all proxies are upgraded in a single transaction.
 *         3. Execute all of the `SET_STORAGE` actions using the `executeActions` function.
 *         4. The `completeUpgrade` function, which upgrades all of the proxies to their new
 *            implementations in a single transaction.
