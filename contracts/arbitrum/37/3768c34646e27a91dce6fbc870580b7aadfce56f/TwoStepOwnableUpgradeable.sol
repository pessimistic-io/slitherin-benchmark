/**
 * @title TwoStepOwnableUpgradeable
 * @notice This contract is a slightly modified version of OpenZeppelin's `OwnableUpgradeable` contract with the
 *         caveat that ownership transfer occurs in two phases. First, the current owner initiates the transfer,
 *         and then the new owner accepts it. Ownership isn't actually transferred until both steps have been
 *         completed. The purpose of this is to ensure that ownership isn't accidentally transferred to the
 *         incorrect address. Note that the initial owner account is the contract deployer by default. Also
 *         note that this contract can only be used through inheritance.
