/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

/*
    MoverTransferProxy is a transfer proxy contract for ERC20 and ETH transfers through Mover infrastructure
    (deposits/withdraws to/from savings products, swaps, etc.)
    - extract fees;
    - call token conversion if needed;
    - deposit/withdraw tokens into holder contracts;
    - non-custodial, not holding any funds;
    - fees are accumulated on this contract's balance (if fees are enabled);

    This contract is a single address that user grants allowance to on any ERC20 token for interacting with HH services.
    This contract could be upgraded in the future to provide subsidized transactions using bonuses from treasury.

    TODO: if token supports permit, provide ability to execute without separate approval call

    version additions:
    - direct deposits to pool (if no fees or conversions);
    - when swapping tokens direct return converted asset to sender (if no fees);
    - ETH support (non-wrapped ETH conversion for deposits and swaps);
    - emergencyTransfer can reclaim ETH
    - support for subsidized transaction execution;
    - bridged transactions support from relay;
    - strategy list fixes for redeem;
    - allowing to decrease of assets value (e.g. for stablecoin swap slippage);
