/**
 * All of Battlefly's wastelands storage is stored in a single WastelandStorage struct.
 *
 * The Diamond Storage pattern (https://dev.to/mudgen/how-diamond-storage-works-90e)
 * is used to set the struct at a specific place in contract storage. The pattern
 * recommends that the hash of a specific namespace (e.g. "battlefly.storage.game")
 * be used as the slot to store the struct.
 *
 * Additionally, the Diamond Storage pattern can be used to access and change state inside
 * of Library contract code (https://dev.to/mudgen/solidity-libraries-can-t-have-state-variables-oh-yes-they-can-3ke9).
 * Instead of using `LibStorage.wastelandStorage()` directly, a Library will probably
 * define a convenience function to accessing state, similar to the `gs()` function provided
 * in the `WithStorage` base contract below.
 *
 * This pattern was chosen over the AppStorage pattern (https://dev.to/mudgen/appstorage-pattern-for-state-variables-in-solidity-3lki)
 * because AppStorage seems to indicate it doesn't support additional state in contracts.
 * This becomes a problem when using base contracts that manage their own state internally.
 *
 * There are a few caveats to this approach:
 * 1. State must always be loaded through a function (`LibStorage.gameStorage()`)
 *    instead of accessing it as a variable directly. The `WithStorage` base contract
 *    below provides convenience functions, such as `gs()`, for accessing storage.
 * 2. Although inherited contracts can have their own state, top level contracts must
 *    ONLY use the Diamond Storage. This seems to be due to how contract inheritance
 *    calculates contract storage layout.
 * 3. The same namespace can't be used for multiple structs. However, new namespaces can
 *    be added to the contract to add additional storage structs.
 * 4. If a contract is deployed using the Diamond Storage, you must ONLY ADD fields to the
 *    very end of the struct during upgrades. During an upgrade, if any fields get added,
 *    removed, or changed at the beginning or middle of the existing struct, the
 *    entire layout of the storage will be broken.
 * 5. Avoid structs within the Diamond Storage struct, as these nested structs cannot be
 *    changed during upgrades without breaking the layout of storage. Structs inside of
 *    mappings are fine because their storage layout is different. Consider creating a new
 *    Diamond storage for each struct.
 *
 * More information on Solidity contract storage layout is available at:
 * https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html
 *
 * Nick Mudge, the author of the Diamond Pattern and creator of Diamond Storage pattern,
 * wrote about the benefits of the Diamond Storage pattern over other storage patterns at
 * https://medium.com/1milliondevs/new-storage-layout-for-proxy-contracts-and-diamonds-98d01d0eadb#bfc1
