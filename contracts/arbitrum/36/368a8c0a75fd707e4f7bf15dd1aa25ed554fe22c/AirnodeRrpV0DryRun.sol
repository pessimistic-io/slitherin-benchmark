/// @title Contract that complements Airnode requestâ€“response protocol (RRP) to
/// allow Airnode to estimate the gas required to execute a fulfillment
/// @dev Typically, contracts are built to revert when an external call they
/// make reverts. In contrast, AirnodeRrpV0 does not revert when the external
/// call during the fulfillment reverts, and instead fails gracefully by
/// emitting a `FailedRequest` event. This event signals to the future
/// invocations of the stateless Airnode to not retry the failed fulfillment.
/// Although this approach meets the intended purpose, it disables Airnode from
/// calling `eth_estimateGas` on `fulfill()` to estimate the gas amount that
/// will be used to execute a fulfillment successfully. Specifically, since
/// `eth_estimateGas` looks for the lowest gas limit that results in the
/// transaction not reverting, and AirnodeRrpV0's `fulfill()` does not revert
/// when its external call reverts (because it runs out of gas),
/// `eth_estimateGas` will not necessarily return a gas amount that will result
/// in the fulfillment to be successful even if such an amount exists.
/// As a solution, Airnode calls `eth_estimateGas` on AirnodeRrpV0DryRun's
/// `fulfill()` and the external call of the fulfillment, and add these up to
/// find the gas limit required to execute a successful fulfillment. This
/// sum is an overestimation of the actual requirement, as it includes an
/// additional base fee (21,000 gas on Ethereum).
