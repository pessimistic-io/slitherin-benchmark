/**
 * @title Converter
 * @author Key Finance
 * @notice 
 * 
 * The main purpose of this contract is to liquidate GMX, esGMX, and the corresponding Multiplier Points (hereinafter referred to as MP) that are staked in the GMX protocol. 
 * This is also called as 'Convert', and when it is completed, GMX tokens (GMX, esGMX) are converted to GMXkey, and MP is converted to MPkey.
 * 
 * The method of liquidating GMX, esGMX, and MP using this contract is as follows:
 * 
 * Prerequisite: There should be no tokens deposited in both the GMX vesting vault and GLP vesting vault on the GMX protocol.
 * 
 * 1. From the account that wants to liquidate GMX, esGMX, and MP, call createTransferReceiver() to deploy an ITransferReceiver(receiver) contract that can receive GMX, esGMX, and MP.
 * 2. From the account that wants to liquidate GMX, esGMX, and MP, call the signalTransfer(receiver) function in the GMX RewardRouter contract.
 * 3. From the account that wants to liquidate GMX, esGMX, and MP, call the completeConversion function to liquidate GMX, esGMX, and MP. 
 *    At this time, the acceptTransfer(sender) function of the RewardRouter is called. Consequently, the received tokens, GMX and esGMX, are liquidated to GMXkey, and MP is liquidated to MPkey.
 * 
 * This contract contains the necessary functions for the above process.
 * Additionally, it provides an admin function for creating MPkey from GMX/esGMX, which is necessary for setting up the DEX pool initially.
