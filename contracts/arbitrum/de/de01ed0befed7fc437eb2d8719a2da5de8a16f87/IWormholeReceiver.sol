    /**
     * @notice Called by the WormholeRelayer contract to deliver a Wormhole message to this contract.
     *
     * @dev This function should be implemented to include access controls to ensure that only
     *      the Wormhole Relayer contract can invoke it.
     *
     *      Implementations should:
     *      - Maintain a mapping of received `deliveryHash`s to prevent duplicate message delivery.
     *      - Verify the authenticity of `sourceChain` and `sourceAddress` to prevent unauthorized or malicious calls.
     *
     * @param payload The arbitrary data included in the message by the sender.
     * @param additionalVaas Additional VAAs that were requested to be included in this delivery.
     *                       Guaranteed to be in the same order as specified by the sender.
     * @param sourceAddress The Wormhole-formatted address of the message sender on the originating chain.
     * @param sourceChain The Wormhole Chain ID of the originating blockchain.
     * @param deliveryHash The VAA hash of the deliveryVAA, used to prevent duplicate delivery.
     *
     * Warning: The provided VAAs are NOT verified by the Wormhole core contract prior to this call.
     *          Always invoke `parseAndVerify()` on the Wormhole core contract to validate the VAAs before trusting them.
