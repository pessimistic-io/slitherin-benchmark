/// @notice `MultiSend` is a contract for sending multiple ETH/ERC20 Tokens to
///  multiple addresses. In addition this contract can call multiple contracts
///  with multiple amounts. There are also TightlyPacked functions which in
///  some situations allow for gas savings. TightlyPacked is cheaper if you
///  need to store input data and if amount is less than 12 bytes. Normal is
///  cheaper if you don't need to store input data or if amounts are greater
///  than 12 bytes. 12 bytes allows for sends of up to 2^96-1 units, 79 billion
///  ETH, so tightly packed functions will work for any ETH send but may not
///  work for token sends when the token has a high number of decimals or a
///  very large total supply. Supports deterministic deployment. As explained
///  here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/777#issuecomment-356103528
