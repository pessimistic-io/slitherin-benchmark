/** @title This contract is specially designed for DAO to DAO swaps
  * The purpose of this is to make it easy for DAO_A with tokenA to swap an exact amount of tokens with DAO_B for tokenB
  * The Swap has an initiator and an executor
  * The initiator is delivering tokenA and amountA in exchange for amountB of tokenB with the executor DAO
  * The initiator sets up the swap parameters, ie tokens to be exchanged, amounts, and other DAO
  * The executor confirms and executes the swap
  * If something is wrong the initiator can cancel the swap anytime unless the executor has already executed it
  * The swaps may lock the tokens or swap them unlocked. If they are locking, the DAOs will utilize the Hedgeys NFT contract
  * to perform the locking of the tokens, which has a single vesting cliff date when the tokens can unlock for each DAO
