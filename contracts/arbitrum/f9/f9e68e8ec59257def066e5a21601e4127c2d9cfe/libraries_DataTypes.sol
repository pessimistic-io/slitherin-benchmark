// What does the signed cost mean?
// In general, it'll be negative when quoting cost to open/increase, and positive when quoting cost to close/decrease.
// However, there are certain situations where that general rule may not hold true, for example when the qty delta is small and the collateral delta is big.
// Scenarios include:
//      * increase position by a tiny bit, but add a lot of collateral at the same time (aka. burn existing debt)
//      * decrease position by a tiny bit, withdraw a lot of excess equity at the same time (aka. issue new debt)
// For this reason, we cannot get rid of the signing, and make assumptions about in which direction the cost will go based on the qty delta alone.
// The effect (or likeliness of this coming into play) is much greater when the funding currency (quote) has a high interest rate.
