/**
 * @dev Used as a proxy for call execution to obscure msg.sender of the
 * caller. msg.sender will be the address of the CallExecutor contract.
 *
 * Instances of Proxy (user account contracts) use CallExecutor to execute
 * unsigned data calls without exposing themselves as msg.sender. Users can
 * sign messages that allow public unsigned data execution via CallExecutor
 * without allowing public calls to be executed directly from their Proxy
 * contract.
 *
 * This is implemented specifically for swap calls that allow unsigned data
 * execution. If unsigned data was executed directly from the Proxy contract,
 * an attacker could make a call that satisfies the swap required conditions
 * but also makes other malicious calls that rely on msg.sender. Forcing all
 * unsigned data execution to be done through a CallExecutor ensures that an
 * attacker cannot impersonate the users's account.
 *
 * ReentrancyGuard is implemented here to revert on callbacks to any verifier
 * functions that use CallExecutorV2.proxyCall()
 * 
 * CallExecutorV2 is modified from https://github.com/brinktrade/brink-verifiers/blob/985900cb405e4d59e37258416d68f36ac443481f/contracts/External/CallExecutor.sol
 * This version adds ReentrancyGuard and removes the data return so that the
 * nonReentrant modifier always unlocks the guard at the end of the function
