 * or a YC Classified function (e.g "func_30(bytes[])")
 *
 * @param is_callback
 * @bool - Specifies whether the function is a callback. Callback means it submits an off-chain request, which
 * should stop the current execution context - Which, in turn, may have itself/another process resumed by the request's
 * fullfill operation.
 *
 * @param is_static
