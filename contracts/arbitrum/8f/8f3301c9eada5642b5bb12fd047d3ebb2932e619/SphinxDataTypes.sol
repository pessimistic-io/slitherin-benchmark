 * @custom:field executor       The address of the caller, which is the only account that is allowed
 *                              to execute calls on the `SphinxModuleProxy` for the Merkle root.
 * @custom:field status         The status of the Merkle root.
 * @custom:field arbitraryChain If this is `true`, the Merkle root can be executed on any chain
 *                              without the explicit permission of the Gnosis Safe owners. This is
 *                              useful if the owners want their system to be permissionlessly
 *                              deployed on new chains. By default, this is disabled, which means
 *                              that the Gnosis Safe owners must explicitly approve the Merkle root
