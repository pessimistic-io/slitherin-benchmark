/** @notice This contract accepts user deposits and withdrawals of a specific token
* The deposits are redirected to an external protocol to generate yield
* Yield is claimed and collected into this contract
* Users accrue portalEnergy points over time while staking their tokens
* portalEnergy can be exchanged against the PSM token using the internal Liquidity Pool or minted as ERC20
* The contract can receive PSM tokens during the funding phase and issues bTokens as receipt
* bTokens can be redeemed against the fundingRewardPool which consists of PSM tokens
* The fundingRewardPool is filled over time by taking a 10% cut from the Converter
* The Converter is an arbitrage mechanism that allows anyone to sweep the contract balance of a token
* When triggering the Converter, the arbitrager must send a fixed amount of PSM tokens to the contract
