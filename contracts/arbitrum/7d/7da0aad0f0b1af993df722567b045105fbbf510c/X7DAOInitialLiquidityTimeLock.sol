Contract: A time lock contract for initial liquidity for X7 Tokens.

This contract will be deployed in place of the "Liquidity Hub" in the X7 ecosystem until token trading is live.
It provides a means for accumulating native token reserves for initial liquidity while providing transparency and safety.
When reserves have reached an acceptable level, the destination will be set to a launch contract which will support airdrop, spot price cash out and launch activities.

This contract will NOT be renounced.

The following are the only functions that can be called on the contract that affect the contract:

    function setUnlockTime(uint256 newTime) external onlyOwner {
        require(newTime > unlockTime, "Cannot decrease time lock");
        unlockTime = newTime;
    }

    function setDestination(address destination_) external onlyOwner {
        require(destination != destination_ && !destinationFrozen);
        destination = destination_;
    }

    function freezeDestination() external onlyOwner {
        require(!destinationFrozen);
        destinationFrozen = true;
    }
