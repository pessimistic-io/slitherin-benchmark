 * @title SuperallowlistERC20
 * @author opnxj
 * @dev The SuperallowlistERC20 contract is an abstract contract that extends the ERC20 token functionality.
 * It adds the ability to manage a denylist and a superallowlist, allowing certain addresses to be excluded from the denylist.
 * The owner can assign a denylister, who is responsible for managing the denylist and adding addresses to it.
 * Addresses on the superallowlist are immune from being denylisted and have additional privileges.
