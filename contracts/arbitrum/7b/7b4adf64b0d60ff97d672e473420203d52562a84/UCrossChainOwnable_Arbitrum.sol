 * @dev This contract has been extended from the Open Zeppelin library to include an
 *      unstructured storage pattern so that it can be safely mixed in with upgradeable
 *      contracts without affecting their storage patterns through inheritance. This contract
 *      is specific to the Arbitrum L2-side and should not be used on other chains.
 *
 *      See {UCrossChainOwnable} for initialization and update usage.
